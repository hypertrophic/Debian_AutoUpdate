# Debian_AutoUpdate
## About This Script

This script is designed to update your system using manual commands (`apt-get update`, `apt-get upgrade`, and `apt-get dist-upgrade`). You might wonder why I chose not to automate these updates using a tool like `cron`. Let's delve into the reasons behind this decision:

### Flexibility and Control

Automating updates with `cron` is a common practice, but it might not always be the best fit for every situation. By opting for manual updates,you get greater control over when and how your system is updated. This can be particularly useful when you need your PC to perform at its best, such as during important tasks, presentations, or resource-intensive activities.

### Performance Considerations

Automatic updates can occasionally impact system performance, especially if they coincide with critical work. By executing updates manually, you can ensure that your hardware and network resources remain dedicated to your tasks without any unexpected slowdowns.

### Internet Connection

In some cases, automatic updates can unexpectedly consume a significant portion of your available internet bandwidth. This might be problematic if you're relying on a limited or shared connection. By choosing to update manually, you can avoid potential disruptions to your internet usage.

### Customization

This script also allows for greater customization. You can choose to update your system precisely when it suits you, ensuring that updates don't interfere with your workflow or commitments.

I believe that offering the option for manual updates aligns with our goal of providing a versatile and user-centric solution. If you find that automatic updates are better suited to your needs, you can always explore other methods or tools such as `cron`.
